# START


The Project is going well. First and foremost, the project started its journey a long time ago (_Possibly 2 months MAX_). The project was actually a program that was created from a random python course lesson. 

Turns out, this project has a lot of potential and so I decided to create a new Repository for it. This repository is centered over a single file called which if you are reading this, it is located over the src folder. The user needs to run the program and it will take over. The good news is that the code is stable as it always it. However, the time had come to improve this code to the next level by transforming it into a MVC Architecture. 


If you are familiar, the MVC means Model-View-Controller. The MVC is a concept that is designed for creating a roadmap that ensures the program's development to advance smoothly without the software code to be rewritten every time and also the MVC allows others to contribute to the code.

It is very difficult to break apart the code. Even if the code is created in encapsulations; the structure could be a pain in the ass to stay seperated. 

There were ideas to make the project be MVC applicable by creating classes. Unfortunately, I forget the basics of the classes in python. As long as I don't learn classes again in python including the most advanced syntax, well then that means is that the code is a no-go for MVC. 

Not to mention that the code is already living over a stable architecture. However, this structure is the functionality explanation of the code. Thus, I don't need to delete the strucuture of the functionality.

I have a lot of plans for this project. Better to get to work as soon as I can.
