Ask yourself this question, we have created a function that does things. Now, if it does things then it'll be nice to just print them to the terminal? Even if all that is done, the another question raises that it be even better to show the colorful displays about it.

Ye. that had became a severe issue right now. The issue is that the render which means the rich from the view requires the data from the model and to get the steady progress report. If the rendering meets an error over the process, then it should be displayed accordingly. That is a a big issue for the project.

The Image-converter requires a set of the instance of the model to be provided to the view over the controller. That means to pass the rendering engine to the model. But doing so is bad for the MVC itself.

For the renderning, I decided that it should be an entire new screen or more like an alternate screen for the code to work on. But there is a catch, I tried to improve the code by ensuring that the alternate screen comes from the view itself. But it doesn't. Instead it needs to be inside the controller.

I tried methods but it didn't work. Calling the alternate screen from the view to the controller is easy. But the rendering doesn't work there for some reason.

As for now, all the alternate screen takes place inside the controller. The instance of the console from the rich library is supported by the view variable of console. So I just imported it without importing rich directly.

As the alternate screen is created for the converting process. It'll be nice if the whole project had been the same.
