Ask yourself this question, we have created a function that does things. Now, if it does things then it'll be nice to just print them to the terminal? Even if all that is done, the another question raises that it be even better to show the colorful displays about it.

Ye. that had became a severe issue right now. The issue is that the render which means the rich from the view requires the data from the model and to get the steady progress report. If the rendering meets an error over the process, then it should be displayed accordingly. That is a a big issue for the project.

The Image-converter requires a set of the instance of the model to be provided to the view over the controller. That means to pass the rendering engine to the model. But doing so is bad for the MVC itself.
